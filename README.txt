The best WordPress comments plugin bringing Medium-like inline comments, threads and reactions.

== Description ==

Engaging Convo is **a FREE supercharged WordPress Comments plugin** like you've (truly) never seen before. It changes the whole commenting game by bringing rich features that are not just beautiful, but actually engaging.

* **Threads** -- visitors can pick part of your article and debate it, no more vague commenting!
* **Reactions** -- add your own reactions and emotions to comments (like, dislike, get mad)!
* **Inline Comments** -- people can comment right from what they read, no need to wait until the article's footer!

[Check it out yourself in action on our demo.](http://demo.engagingconvo.com/vegetarianism-has-billions-of-perks/ "Demo article")

**LET'S EMPOWER COMMENTS.**

Current WordPress comments and plugins sit at the bottom of your page, below the article, in a zone called the cemetery. For the lucky visitors scrolling that far down, they simply don't look engaging. Sure, some plugins make them look better, add some color and fancy social media buttons. **But guess what? You don't put make-up on an ugly girl.**

We've thought outside of the box and created Engaging Convo. A WordPress comments plugin that adds threads, inline-comments, and reactions to your blog.

People can **select a sentence in your article and start a conversation**. No more general comments that nobody reads. Now, people can pinpoint a precise part and discuss it.

When a conversation is happening on a precise topic, that sentence is highlighted so new visitors can clearly see that people have commented on it. They can click or tap that sentence and participate themselves.

**UPGRADE TO PRO FOR MORE!**

The plugin is free and work amazingly well. The free version will highlight the most commented thread, while the other ones will appear below the article.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it a free plugin? =

Of course, the plugin is totally free. You can add paying extensions down the line if you wish to.

= What extensions does this plugin have? =

Some of the extensions currently available for Engaging Convo include Advanced Settings so you can customise colors and several other aspects of the plugin; Reactions to add personalized 'Like', 'Angry', or anything really, to comments; and Email Notifications to allow users to receive notifications whenever somebody replies to them.

= Will my old comments still appear? =

Most definitely, yes! Each post has an orphanage that is where your comments have always been. It will display all the comments linked to no thread in particular. People can still comment at the footer of each article :)

= Will I lose the comments if I deactivate or delete Engaging Convo? =

No, the comments will remain and will show like they always did before. We built Engaging Convo using WordPress Comments and just supercharged them. So don't worry :)

== Screenshots ==

1. Example of how comments threads are highlighted in your blog post. 
2. Once people click/tap the highlighted thread, they see all the comments and can join the conversation!
3. You can limit highlighted threads to a number, and other threads will appear below the article.
4. Use advanced settings to change limitations, colors, styles, and so on.
5. Add your own Reactions (LOL, Like, Hate, Mad, Poop, etc.) and set the spam limits
6. When editing an existing post, threads will turn red if you break part of the article visitors commented on.
